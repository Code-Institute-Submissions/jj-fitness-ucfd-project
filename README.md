Code Institute - User-Centric Frontend Development Project  
Josh Jones Fitness  
by Alex Mortali  

This is a website for Josh Jones's personal training business. 
The website serves to create an online presence for Josh, it covers a bit about himself, his clients, the services he provides, 
a contact form and links to his social media.
The website also includes a free pdf for his clients to download.

Demo

UX  
When speaking with Josh he stated he doesn't want the website to feel intimidating but instead welcoming, easy to use and 
easy to navigate. This is why I have used a lot of negative space with a minimalist design to create a soft and easy feel. 
The grey/blue color scheme compliments to the open feel and links with the colors used in Josh's training facility.

The users are able to get a glimpse of Josh's background, a testimonial from a client, the training service he provides, 
and contact him if they wish. All of this is doable within a few clicks due to the sleek user friendly design.

In the footer section there are links to his social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter). The is also a free downloadable PDF 
of his 6 pack guide provided to help build customer relations. 

Features

Feaures Left To Implement  
In the future the website will have a check in system where clients can book a session directly through the website. 
As of right now they have to contact Josh through the 'Contact' form.

Also in the 'clients' section of the website there will be an option too view other clients testimonials. This will be 
implemented when Josh's client base grows using the 'Carousel' feature within Bootstrap.

Technologies Used  
1 - HTML: This project uses HTML as the skeleton of the website.  
2 - CSS: This project uses CSS to control the presentation of the website.  
3 - Bootstrap(3.3.7): This project uses Bootstrap as it's framework to make the site responsive.
